## ‚ö° Enlightening Questions

### ‚ùì How to Get Results for My Queries?

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enter your search queries.

![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

2. Now, simply press the Run button.

![Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/run.png)

### ‚ùì What are the different pages and how do they help me?

Primarily, there are 3 pages in the UI Dashboard:

- Home Page ('/')
- Output Page ('/output')
- Results Page ('/output/1')

#### Home Page ('/')

![Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/homepage.png)

You can input your queries here and search by:
- List of queries
![Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/queries.png)

- List of links
![links-queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/links-queries.png)

- Scrape data for a specific type of business across all cities in a country.
![country-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/country-section.png)

- Get Social Details of Profiles like Email, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
![social-section.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/social-section.png)

Extracting social details is a compute-intensive process that involves searching various directories and websites parallelly using proxies. To help with this process, we've created an API.

Kindly follow these steps to use the API and get the social details of the profiles:

1. Sign up on RapidAPI by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up).

![Sign Up on RapidAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sign-up.png)

2. Subscribe to the Free Plan by visiting [this link](https://rapidapi.com/Chetan11dev/api/website-social-scraper-api/pricing).

![Subscribe to Free Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/subscribe.png)

3. Copy the API key.
![Copy the API Key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/key.png)

4. Put the Key in the "Email and Social Links Extraction" section and run it:

![social-section.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/social-section.png)

The first 200 contact details are free to scrape with the API. After that, you can upgrade to the Pro Plan to scrape 1,000 contacts for $9, which is affordable considering if you land just one customer, you could easily make hundreds of dollars, easily covering the investment.

- Scrape Reviews
![reviews-section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/reviews-section.png)

Kindly note that due to privacy concerns, we do not scrape personally identifiable information of reviewers, such as names, profile photos, and review links. We only scrape the review text, rating, owner response, and similar non-personally identifiable information.

#### Output Page ('/output')
![output-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/output-page.png)

The Output page helps you manage your tasks. You can use it to:

- See tasks and their status (pending, in progress, or completed).
- Abort or delete any task.
![abort-delete.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/abort-delete.png)

- Additionally, Whenever you run a query, a task named "All Task" will be created for it, which combines results from multiple queries.

For example, if you search for "Web Developers in Bangalore" and "Web Developers in Mumbai", the "All Task" will show you the combined results for both queries.

![all-task.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/all-task.png)

#### Results Page ('/output/1')
![results-page.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/results-page.png)

This is the most important page where you can view, sort, filter, or download the results of the task.

**Sorting**

![sort.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort.png)

By default, we sort the listings using a really good sorting order, which is as follows ("Best Potential Customers"):

- Reviews [Businesses with more reviews come first]
- Website [Businesses more open to technology come first]
- Is Spending On Ads [Businesses already investing in ads are more likely to invest in your product, so they appear first.]

You can also sort by other criteria, such as name or reviews.

![sort-small.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/sort-small.png)

**Filters**

![filter.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/filter.png)

To find the exact results you're looking for, click the "Show Filters" button and apply the desired filters.

**Export**

![export.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/master/screenshots/export.png)

Download results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel) using the export button.
